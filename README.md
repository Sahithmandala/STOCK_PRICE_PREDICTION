# STOCK_PRICE_PREDICTION

Google Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

 Project Overview
This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Google stock prices based on historical data. LSTM networks are well-suited for time-series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

    Dataset
   File: `google_dataset.csv`
   Source: Contains historical stock prices of Google.
   Columns: Typically includes Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (the model mainly uses the `Close` price for prediction).

 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy & Pandas — Data manipulation
- Matplotlib — Visualization
- TensorFlow / Keras — Deep Learning model building
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) — Time-series prediction
